Another file for demonestrating  grep command usage.
it allows us to do CASE Insensetive string test
as well
we can also do recursive SEARCH in a directory
using -R and -r Options.
grep allows to give a regular expression to
search for a PATTERN.
Some special characters like . * () {} $ ^ ?
are used to form regexp
Range of digit can be given to regexp e.g [3-6]
[7-9],[0-9]
